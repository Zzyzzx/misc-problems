href=\"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/quote\/FB\/\">NASDAQ:FB<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>When it comes to market capitalization, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/facebook\/\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"facebook\">Facebook <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> was worth $629.6 billion yesterday. The company is now worth $506.2. In other words, Facebook has lost $123.4 billion in value overnight.<\/p>\n<p>Today\u2019s performance isn\u2019t due to yet another data misuse or election interfering scandal. The company has reported <a title=\"Facebook stock tanks from mixed Q2 with slowest-ever growth\" href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/07\/25\/facebook-q2-2018-earnings\/\">disappointing earnings<\/a>. For the first time, Facebook\u2019s growth is stalling.<\/p>\n<p>There are barely more people checking Facebook every day compared to previous quarter. Even worse, Facebook\u2019s user base shrank in Europe. Facebook is still growing, but it\u2019s clear that GDPR combined with a saturated market aren\u2019t helping the company.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why Facebook is trying to change the narrative. For the first time, the company shared a new \u201cfamily of apps audience\u201d metric. There are 2.5 billion people using at least one of the company\u2019s app \u2014 Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s clear that Facebook thinks Instagram and ephemeral stories represent the future of the company. But this is going to be a question mark in the coming months as it\u2019s unclear if Instagram can generate as much money as Facebook\u2019s main app.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1680773\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Screen-Shot-2018-07-26-at-3.33.20-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"546\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Measuring Facebook\u2019s losses<\/h2>\n<p>$123,400,000,000 is a big number. It\u2019s hard to grasp how much it represents given the scale of big tech companies. As TechCrunch\u2019s Jon Russell pointed out, bitcoin\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/coinmarketcap.com\/currencies\/bitcoin\/\">entire market capitalization<\/a> is currently $141 billion. So it\u2019s like nearly all bitcoins disappeared overnight.<\/p>\n<p>Who would have thought Facebook could be more volatile than bitcoin?<\/p>\n<p>Even if you compare it to significant tech companies, this is a huge loss. For instance, <a href=\"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/quote\/NFLX\">Netflix<\/a> is worth $158 billion right now. <a href=\"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/quote\/TWTR\">Twitter\u2019s<\/a> market cap is <em>only<\/em> $33 billion. It\u2019s like Facebook shaved off nearly 4 Twitters in market cap overnight. And I\u2019m not even talking about <a href=\"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/quote\/SNAP?p=SNAP\">Snap<\/a>, which is only worth $17 billion.<\/p>\n<h2>Changing Facebook\u2019s business model<\/h2>\n<p>Most people have been focused on Facebook\u2019s losses for now. It\u2019s a staggering event. But it\u2019s now time to look at Facebook\u2019s business model and understand what\u2019s happening.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook is an incredible success story. It became a massive business in just a few years. But the company has a dangerous business model. Thousands of employees are looking for ways to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/04\/14\/how-to-save-your-privacy-from-the-internets-clutches\/\">collect more data<\/a>. Business teams can then sell expensive ads because they\u2019re perfectly targeted.<\/p>\n<p>And the best way to optimize those efficient ads is by making addictive products. If you spend more time looking at stories, you\u2019re going to be exposed to more ads.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why Facebook optimizes for engagement. You get outraged, you become sad, you like and you share. And Facebook makes money.<\/p>\n<p>This year is a turning point for Facebook. People will look back at this moment as an inflection point in the company\u2019s trajectory. But it\u2019s still unclear if Facebook has the answer to its structural issues.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In what could be the biggest one-day drop of all time, Facebook shares opened at $174.89, down 19.6 percent compared to yesterday\u2019s closing price of $217.50 (NASDAQ:FB).

Lenovo&#8217;s Google Smart Display is pretty and intelligent"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Smart speakers have come a long way over the past few years as Amazon, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/google\/\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"google\">Google <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> and Apple have delivered pretty noteworthy strides in the IQs of their assistants. Where speakers haven&#8217;t advanced as much is in how they offer users choices; Google Assistant can only list out so many options before you get sick of listening, so throwing a screen onto these devices was a pretty inevitable evolution.<\/p>\n<p>At CES earlier this year, Google showcased what it called Smart Displays, basically an answer to Amazon&#8217;s Echo Show. Today, Lenovo&#8217;s device, the first of the bunch, goes on sale.<\/p>\n<p>The device, to be clear, pretty much just looks like an Android tablet that you plug in with Google Assistant on it. What&#8217;s interesting is how the device handles visual feedback for audio commands, giving lightweight visual context for some queries and more robust video\/photo content for others. Google clearly doesn&#8217;t have all of the core tenets of its Smart Display interface philosophy hammered out, and yet for the most part this is a very pleasant product that strikes all of the right notes on design.<\/p>\n[gallery ids=\"1680847,1680844,1680843,1680845\"]\n<p>The device comes in two flavors, a $249 10-inch 1080p version and a $199 8-inch 720p version. There aren&#8217;t any differences beyond the screen size, so it really depends on where you&#8217;re keeping it. I&#8217;d imagine that people who are putting something like this on their nightstand as a way-too-smart alarm clock might want the smaller version, whereas if you have a bit more room in your kitchen or living room the 10-inch version might offer some needed screen real estate. For this review I tested the 10-inch $249 variant.<\/p>\n<p>While I didn&#8217;t have too many qualms with the hardware, it was much easier to pick out things that bothered me about the way Google has approached the Smart Display software. While some tasks were refreshingly thought out, like searching for and progressing through recipe instructions, others, like finding a specific YouTube video, were frustratingly difficult.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1680888 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/IMG_20180726_081844.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"422\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The Smart Display is fundamentally a Google Home device that can also communicate to you through visuals. It may look like a tablet with a speaker, but you will not find anything resembling a full app on the device, you will not be entering text via an onscreen keyboard and you certainly will never see a &#8220;menu&#8221; button. This is a tablet with an identity crisis, a product that can use certain functionality to communicate with you but also wants you to speak with your words and let its AI prowess do the more stringent work of\u00a0 telling you what you would like.<\/p>\n<p>Asking the device to &#8220;open YouTube&#8221; will take you to a screen with a list of recommended videos and&#8230; nothing else. Fair enough, everything is sparsely simple, but it&#8217;s frankly a little annoying to wander through voice commands to navigate to something right in front of you that you know you could tap toward much more quickly. This is one of the key advantages that the Smart Display holds over the Amazon Echo Show, so I just feel like they should have been a little bit more heavy-handed in porting a fuller version of the app.<\/p>\n<p>The onscreen content is more often than not just an added perk; for more informational queries it can be useful to see what a person looks like if you&#8217;re asking Google who they are, and it can be useful to see a five-day weather forecast rather than having Alexa list all of the days out. For the most part, it seems less than necessary, and I rarely found myself actually looking at the screen after I had asked a question.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1680887 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/IMG_20180726_081923.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"462\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Google has been doing some work in stringing commands together or adding support for follow-up questions in some contexts, but with a screen that can now show you the device is still listening I wish the company just kept the mic running during certain situations. When you&#8217;re progressing through the steps of a recipe, for instance, each time you have to keep repeating &#8220;Hey Google, next!&#8221; (you can also tap an onscreen button but that&#8217;s not always ideal when deep in cooking).<\/p>\n<p>Some of these features could use updates, but there are other things that Google has nailed, right out of the box. Routines are great on the Smart Display. Saying,&#8221;Hey Google, good morning,&#8221; will turn on my lights, tell me about my meetings for the day, showcase the weather and my commute and give a nice little rundown of the news. This was all possible on my display-less Google Home already, but something about doing this on the Smart Display just feels much more Jarvis-like, \u00e0 la Tony Stark, and I feel like I&#8217;m living in a fairly cool future, as long as I cut off the news headlines in time.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1680842\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/IMG_20180726_072459_2.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"428\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s take a closer look at the hardware, though, because Lenovo has actually built a very thoughtful product, and I must say it&#8217;s been a little bit since I&#8217;ve been wowed by consumer hardware coming from them. More often than not, Lenovo gear seems to occupy that area where it&#8217;s mostly quite good but one or two things are off and the whole thing just feels second-tier as a result. Their Smart Display, on the other hand, is beautiful and, honestly, much better-looking than any Home product that Google has shipped.<\/p>\n<p>Sound-wise, this speaker is also much better than I was expecting for its small footprint. It seems louder and crisper than the standard Google Home, falling short of those metrics when compared to the pricier Max, though you are also certainly getting less speaker for your money than a comparably priced (but screen-less) product like the Sonos One. Both JBL and LG also have smart display products in the pipeline that seem to place more of an emphasis on powerful sound, but the whole boombox look that they have going just doesn&#8217;t do it for me.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1680852\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/lg-thinq-wk9-1.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"340\" \/><\/p>\n<p>There were a couple of hardware quirks with Lenovo&#8217;s Smart Display, but really nothing major. I wasn&#8217;t generally getting the greatest viewing angle from the device on my kitchen counter, so some sort of hinge on the stand would have been nice to adjust the angle of the screen. The device&#8217;s ability to be viewable in both portrait and landscape was interesting, but you can really only use it in portrait for Duo calls as Google doesn&#8217;t really seem to want the Smart Display to be used in that orientation.\u00a0The touchscreen was also at times a little less responsive than I would have liked, but fared well enough by and large.<\/p>\n<p>Lenovo&#8217;s Smart Display is very pretty and offers some great value as well as some interesting ideas from Google. It strangely doesn&#8217;t feel like a huge upgrade over its screen-less Google Home variants, especially because navigating videos is still a bit harder than it should be, but with pretty decent sound and a few nice visual feedback features there are some very novel ideas present even if they don&#8217;t feel entirely fleshed out.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Smart speakers have come a long way over the past few years as Amazon, Google and Apple have delivered pretty noteworthy strides in the IQs of their assistants.

The company eventually did so, releasing ads run by AIQ for the official Vote Leave campaign, BeLeave\/Brexit Central, and DUP Vote Leave.<\/p>\n<p>Several of the Brexit campaigns whose ads have now been made public were also\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/07\/17\/its-official-brexit-campaign-broke-the-law-with-social-medias-help\/\">recently found to have broken UK election law<\/a> by breaching campaign spending limits. Most notably the Electoral Commission found that the youth-focused campaign, BeLeave, had been joint-working with the official Vote Leave campaign &#8212; yet the pair had not jointly declared spending thereby enabling the official campaign to overspend by almost half a million pounds.\u00a0And that overspend went straight to\u00a0Aggregate IQ to run targeted Facebook ads.<\/p>\n<p>The committee has now published the Brexit ads that Facebook disclosed to it, more than two years after the referendum vote took place. Facebook also provided it with ad impression ranges and some targeting data which it has also published. The committee&#8217;s enquiry remains ongoing.<\/p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.parliament.uk\/documents\/commons-committees\/culture-media-and-sport\/Fake_news_evidence\/Letter-from-Rebecca-Stimson-Facebook-to-Chair-re-question-29-19-July-2018.pdf\">letter<\/a> to the committee, Facebook says it&#8217;s unable to disclose ads run by AIQ for another Brexit campaign, Veterans for Britain, saying that campaign &#8220;has not permitted us to disclose that information to you&#8221;.\u00a0So the view of the Brexit political ads we&#8217;re finally getting is by no means complete. Facebook&#8217;s platform also essentially enables anyone to be an advertiser &#8212; so it&#8217;s entirely possible other Brexit related messages were distributed using its ad tools.<\/p>\n<p>In the case of the Brexit ads run by AIQ specifically, it&#8217;s not clear how many ad impressions they racked up in all. But total impressions look very sizable.<\/p>\n<p>While some of what runs to many thousands of distinctly targeted ads which AIQ distributed via Facebook&#8217;s platform are listed as only garnering between 0-999 impressions apiece, according to Facebook&#8217;s data, others racked up far more views. Commonly listed ranges include 50,000 to 99,999 and 100,000 to 199,999 &#8212; with even higher ranges like 2M-4.9M and 5M-9.9M also listed.<\/p>\n<p>One ad that generated ad impressions of between 2M-4.9M was targeted almost exclusively (99%) at English Facebook users &#8212; and included the claim that:\u00a0&#8220;EU protectionism has prevented our generation from benefiting from key global trade deals. It is time we unite to give our country the freedom to be a prosperous and competitive nation!&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>A spokesperson for the DCMS committee told us it hadn&#8217;t had a chance to compiled the thousands of ad impression ranges into a total ad impression range &#8212; but had rather published the data as it had received it from Facebook. We&#8217;ve also asked the company to prove an estimate on the total ad impressions and will update this story with any response.<\/p>\n<p>The ad creative used by these campaigns has been published as well and &#8212; across all of them &#8212; the adverts display a mixture of (roundly debunked) claims about suddenly being able to spend &#8216;\u00a3350M a week on the NHS&#8217;, rousing calls to &#8216;take back control&#8217; (including a bunch of &#8216;hero&#8217; shots of Boris Johnson), coupled with ample fearmongering about EU regulations &#8216;holding the UK back&#8217; or posing a risk to UK jobs and wages; plus a lot of out-and-out &#8216;project fear&#8217; messaging &#8212; with the official Vote Leave campaign especially deploying direct dogwhistle racism to stir up fear among voters about foreigners coming to the UK if it can&#8217;t control its own border or if the EU expands to add more countries&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1680885\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Screen-Shot-2018-07-26-at-5.22.12-PM.png?w=600\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"314\" \/>\u00a0<img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1680890\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Screen-Shot-2018-07-26-at-5.25.05-PM.png?w=598\" alt=\"\" width=\"598\" height=\"313\" \/><\/p>\n<p>At a glance, the Brexit ad creative is not\u00a0as &#8216;out there&#8217; as some of the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/11\/01\/us\/politics\/russia-2016-election-facebook.html\">wilder stuff the Kremlin was pumping onto Facebook&#8217;s platform<\/a> to try to skew the 2016 U.S. election.<\/p>\n<p>But the blatant xenophobia leaves a very bad taste.<\/p>\n<p>In the case of Brexit Central\/BeLeave, their ad creative was more subtle in its xenophobia &#8212; urging target recipients to back a &#8220;fair immigration system&#8221; or an &#8220;Australian-style points based system&#8221; but without making any direct references to any specific non-EU countries.<\/p>\n<p>The youth campaign also created a couple of ads (below) which invoked consumer technology as a reason to back Brexit &#8212; with one appealing to users of ride-hailing and another to users of video streaming apps to reject the EU by suggesting its regulations might interfere with access to the services they use.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1680896\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Screen-Shot-2018-07-26-at-3.57.49-PM.png?w=601\" alt=\"\" width=\"601\" height=\"318\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1680902\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Screen-Shot-2018-07-26-at-3.58.11-PM.png?w=599\" alt=\"\" width=\"599\" height=\"323\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Ironically enough, it was London&#8217;s transport authority that <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/09\/22\/uber-loses-its-license-to-operate-in-london\/\">withdrew Uber&#8217;s license to operate last year<\/a> &#8212; in a regulatory decision that had absolutely nothing to do with the EU. (Uber has since appealed and got a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/06\/26\/uber-wins-appeal-and-gets-a-provisional-15-month-license-to-operate-in-london\/\">15-month reprieve<\/a>.)<\/p>\n<p>Though, also last year, the EU&#8217;s top court judged that a spade is a spade &#8212; and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/12\/20\/blow-to-uber-in-europe-as-top-court-rules-its-a-transport-service\/\">Uber is a transport company<\/a>, not a mere technology platform. Though the ruling has not prevented Uber from continuing to operate and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/05\/10\/uber-to-pop-up-a-service-in-spains-costa-del-sol-in-time-for-summer\/\">even expand ride-hailing services in Europe<\/a>. Sure, it has to work more closely with\u00a0city authorities now, but that means meshing with local priorities rather than seeking to override what local people want.<\/p>\n<p>In a further irony, the EU also took steps to liberalize passenger transport services, back in 2007, issuing a directive that makes it harder for cities authorities to place their own controls on ride-hailing services.\u00a0Albeit, evidently facts didn&#8217;t get a starring role in the vote leave Brexit ads.<\/p>\n<p>As for quotas on streaming services, it&#8217;s a curious thing to complain about &#8212; especially to a youth-focused audience which you&#8217;re also targeting with ads claiming they&#8217;ll have better job prospects outside the EU.<\/p>\n<p>The EU has merely suggested online streaming services should provide for and subsidize up to a third of their output of films and TV as being\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/technology\/2018\/apr\/26\/eu-third-party-trader-amazon-google-ebay\">made in Europe<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Which seems unlikely to have a\u00a0deleterious impact on European creative industries, given platforms would be contributing to the development of local audiovisual production. So &#8212; in plainer English &#8212; it should mean more money to support more creative jobs in Europe which many young people would probably love to have a crack at&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>The publication of the Brexit ads is, above all, a reminder that online political advertising has been allowed to be a blackhole &#8212; and at times a cesspit &#8212; because cash-rich entities have been able to unaccountably exploit the obscurity of Facebook&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/04\/28\/facebooks-dark-ads-problem-is-systemic\/\">systemically dark ad targeting tools<\/a> for their own ends, leaving no right of public objection let alone reply for the people as a whole whose lives are affected by political outcomes such as referendums.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook has been making some voluntary changes to offer a degree of political ad disclosure, as it seeks to stave off regulatory rule. Whether its changes &#8212; which at best offer partial visibility &#8212; will go far enough remains to be seen. And of course they come too late to change the conversation around Brexit.<\/p>\n<p>Which is why, earlier this month, the UK&#8217;s data watchdog calling for <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/07\/11\/facebook-under-fresh-political-pressure-as-uk-watchdog-calls-for-ethical-pause-of-ad-ops\/\">an ethical pause of political ad ops<\/a>\u00a0&#8212; saying there&#8217;s a risk of democracy being digitally undermined.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It is important that there is greater and genuine transparency about the use of such techniques to ensure that people have control over their own data and that the law is upheld,&#8221; it wrote. &#8220;Without a high level of transparency \u2013 and therefore trust amongst citizens that their data is being used appropriately \u2013 we are at risk of developing a system of voter surveillance by default.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The UK parliament has provided another telling glimpse behind the curtain of Facebook&#8217;s unregulated ad platform by publishing data on scores of pro-Brexit adverts which it distributed to UK voters during the 2016 referendum on European Union membership.

The extent of their efforts was truly staggering.<\/p>\n<p>One defendant, Miteshkumar Patel of Illinois, received 240 months in prison followed by three years of probation. Patel, wrote the Department of Justice, &#8220;served as the manager of a Chicago-based crew of &#8216;runners&#8217; that liquidated and laundered fraud proceeds generated by callers at India-based call centers.&#8221;<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Those callers used call scripts and lead lists to target victims throughout the United States with telefraud schemes in which the callers impersonated U.S. government employees from the IRS and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). The callers duped victims into believing that they owed money to the U.S. government and would be arrested or deported if they did not pay immediately. After the victims transferred money to the callers, a network of U.S.-based runners moved expeditiously to liquidate and launder fraud proceeds through the use of anonymous stored value cards. In addition to recruiting, training, and tasking runners in his crew, Patel also coordinated directly with the Indian side of the conspiracy about the operation of the scheme. Patel was held accountable for laundering between $9.5 and $25 million for the scheme.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The scam &#8212; familiar to anyone with a phone number &#8212; involves a robocall that appears to be from the IRS. When you call back, you get a call center staffed with threatening non-English speakers who yell at you if you try to weasel out of paying them with iTunes gift cards.<\/p>\n<span class=\"embed-youtube embed breakout embed--video\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text\/html' width='640' height='390' src='https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/EzedMdx6QG4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'><\/iframe><\/span>\n<p>\u201cThis type of fraud is sickening,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Ryan Patrick in a release. \u201cHowever, after years of investigation and incredible hard work by multiple agents and attorneys, these con artists are finally headed to prison. Their cruel tactics preyed on some very vulnerable people, thereby stealing millions from them. These sentences should send a strong message that we will follow the trail no matter how difficult and seek justice for those victimized by these types of transnational schemes. We will simply not stand by and allow criminals to use the names of legitimate government agencies to enrich themselves by victimizing others.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The fact that up to $25 million was collected in this scam is amazing.

year-over-year in the quarter compared to last year&#8217;s second quarter. It&#8217;s also up 49% year-over-year when comparing the most recent six months to the same period last year. AWS is now on a run rate well north of $10 billion annually, generating more than $6 billion in revenue in the second quarter this year. Meanwhile, amazon&#8217;s retail operations generated nearly $47 billion with a net income of just over $1.3 billion (unaudited). Amazon&#8217;s AWS generated $1.6 billion in operating income on its $6.1 billion in revenue.<\/p>\n<p>So, in short, Amazon&#8217;s dramatically more efficient AWS business is its biggest contributor to its actual net income. The company reported earnings of $5.07 per share, compared to analyst estimates of around $2.50 per share, on revenue of $52.9 billion. That revenue number fell under what investors were looking for, so the stock isn&#8217;t really doing anything in after hours and Amazon still remains in the race to become a company with a market cap of $1 trillion alongside Google, Apple and Microsoft.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1681127\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/aws-vs-amazon.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"550\" height=\"565\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This isn&#8217;t extremely surprising as Amazon was one of the original harbingers of the move to a cloud computing-focused world, and as a result Microsoft and Google are now chasing it to capture up as much share as possible.

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While artificial intelligence was once heralded as the key to unlocking a\u00a0new\u00a0era of economic prosperity, policymakers today face a wave of calls to ensure AI is fair, ethical and safe. New\u00a0York City Mayor de Blasio recently announced the formation of the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www1.nyc.gov\/office-of-the-mayor\/news\/251-18\/mayor-de-blasio-first-in-nation-task-force-examine-automated-decision-systems-used-by\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?hl=en&amp;q=http:\/\/www1.nyc.gov\/office-of-the-mayor\/news\/251-18\/mayor-de-blasio-first-in-nation-task-force-examine-automated-decision-systems-used-by&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1531845642735000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHIXdpOishxzsYZfRgRNuxmgGedww\">nation\u2019s first task force<\/a>\u00a0to monitor and assess the use of algorithms. Days later, the European Union enacted sweeping\u00a0new data protection rules that require companies be able to explain to consumers any\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www2.datainnovation.org\/2018-impact-gdpr-ai.pdf\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?hl=en&amp;q=http:\/\/www2.datainnovation.org\/2018-impact-gdpr-ai.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1531845642735000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEunNUs8bNhF_wR8zPwUIiwjHKX0A\">automated decisions<\/a>. And high-profile critics, like\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.c-span.org\/video\/?431119-6\/elon-musk-addresses-nga\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?hl=en&amp;q=https:\/\/www.c-span.org\/video\/?431119-6\/elon-musk-addresses-nga&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1531845642735000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGWsFU8k5iCiUJt2PSqxX4D7HiOfQ\">Elon Musk<\/a>, have called on policymakers to do more to regulate AI.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, the two most popular ideas \u2014 requiring companies to disclose the source code to their algorithms and explain how they make decisions \u2014 would cause more harm than good by regulating the business models and the inner workings of the algorithms of companies using AI, rather than holding these companies accountable for outcomes.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first idea \u2014 \u201calgorithmic transparency\u201d \u2014 would require companies to disclose the source code and data used in their AI systems. Beyond its simplicity, this idea lacks any real merits as a wide-scale solution. Many AI systems are too complex to fully understand by looking at source code alone. Some AI systems rely on millions of data points and thousands of lines of code, and decision models can change over time as they encounter\u00a0new\u00a0data. It is unrealistic to expect even the most motivated, resource-flush regulators or concerned citizens to be able to spot all potential malfeasance when that system\u2019s developers\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.technologyreview.com\/s\/604087\/the-dark-secret-at-the-heart-of-ai\/\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?hl=en&amp;q=https:\/\/www.technologyreview.com\/s\/604087\/the-dark-secret-at-the-heart-of-ai\/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1531845642735000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHj7IM70v9V0p36rl2SFPxpiXESQA\">may be unable to do so<\/a>\u00a0either.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, not all companies have an open-source business model. Requiring them to disclose their source code reduces their incentive to invest in developing\u00a0new\u00a0algorithms, because it invites competitors to copy them. Bad actors in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.axios.com\/china-broke-hacking-pact-before-new-tariff-tiff-d19f5604-f9ce-458a-a50a-2f906c8f12ab.html\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?hl=en&amp;q=https:\/\/www.axios.com\/china-broke-hacking-pact-before-new-tariff-tiff-d19f5604-f9ce-458a-a50a-2f906c8f12ab.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1531845642735000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGcAJW2mpRTRxFFpz5KznZEgyrT_w\">China<\/a>, which is fiercely competing with the United States for AI dominance but routinely flouts intellectual property rights, would likely use transparency requirements to steal source code.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The other idea \u2014 &#8220;algorithmic explainability\u201d \u2014 would require companies to explain to consumers how their algorithms make decisions. The problem with this proposal is that there is often an inescapable trade-off between explainability and accuracy in AI systems. An algorithm\u2019s accuracy typically scales with its complexity, so the more complex an algorithm is, the more difficult it is to explain. While this could change in the future as research into explainable AI matures \u2014 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/11\/21\/magazine\/can-ai-be-taught-to-explain-itself.html\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?hl=en&amp;q=https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/11\/21\/magazine\/can-ai-be-taught-to-explain-itself.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1531845642735000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGA2gRAQLYRbvm135-qsszuo1Ch6A\">DARPA devoted $75 million in 2017<\/a>\u00a0to this problem \u2014 for now, requirements for explainability would come at the cost of accuracy. This is enormously dangerous. With autonomous vehicles, for example, is it more important to be able to explain an accident or avoid one? The cases where explanations are more important than accuracy are rare.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;\">\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--center\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tThe debate about how to make AI safe has ignored the need for a nuanced, targeted approach to regulation.\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rather than demanding companies reveal their source code or limiting the types of algorithms they can use, policymakers should instead insist on\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.datainnovation.org\/2018\/05\/how-policymakers-can-foster-algorithmic-accountability\/\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?hl=en&amp;q=http:\/\/www.datainnovation.org\/2018\/05\/how-policymakers-can-foster-algorithmic-accountability\/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1531845642735000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHBmuBhl61lH1CUizhLnd34v3xddQ\">algorithmic accountability\u00a0<\/a>\u2014 the principle that an algorithmic system should employ a variety of controls to ensure the operator (i.e. the party responsible for deploying the algorithm) can verify it acts as intended, and identify and rectify harmful outcomes should they occur.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A policy framework built around algorithmic accountability would have several important benefits. First, it would make operators responsible for any harms their algorithms might cause, not developers. Not only do operators have the most influence over how algorithms impact society, but they already have to comply with a variety of laws designed to make sure their decisions don\u2019t cause harm. For example, employers must comply with anti-discrimination laws in hiring, regardless of whether they use algorithms to make those decisions.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second, holding operators accountable for outcomes rather than the inner workings of algorithms would free them to focus on the best methods to ensure their algorithms do not cause harm, such as confidence measures, impact assessments or procedural regularity, where appropriate. For example, a university could conduct an impact assessment before deploying an AI system designed to predict which students are likely to drop out to ensure it is effective and equitable. Unlike transparency or explainability requirements, this would enable the university to effectively identify any potential flaws without prohibiting the use of complex, proprietary algorithms.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is not to say that transparency and explanations do not have their place. Transparency requirements, for example, make sense for\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.rstreet.org\/2017\/12\/01\/when-it-comes-to-criminal-justice-ai-we-need-transparency-and-accountability\/\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?hl=en&amp;q=https:\/\/www.rstreet.org\/2017\/12\/01\/when-it-comes-to-criminal-justice-ai-we-need-transparency-and-accountability\/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1531845642735000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE_LXU-Ha8DgKy3NSa3Lfb_dS8pXw\">risk-assessment algorithms in the criminal justice system<\/a>.

Consumers will still have a right to these explanations regardless of whether a company uses AI to make its decisions.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The debate about how to make AI safe has ignored the need for a nuanced, targeted approach to regulation, treating algorithmic transparency and explainability like silver bullets without considering their many downsides. There is nothing wrong with wanting to mitigate the potential harms AI poses, but the oversimplified, overbroad solutions put forth so far would be largely ineffective and likely do more harm than good. Algorithmic accountability offers a better path toward ensuring organizations use AI responsibly so that it can truly be a boon to society.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>While artificial intelligence was once heralded as the key to unlocking a\u00a0new\u00a0era of economic prosperity, policymakers today face a wave of calls to ensure AI is fair, ethical and safe.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":84837756,"featured_media":1330955,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"outcome":"","status":"","crunchbase_tag":0,"amp_status":"","relegenceEntities":[],"relegenceSubjects":[]},"categories":[424613844,25515],"tags":[449555589],"crunchbase_tag":[],"tc_stories_tax":[],"tc_event":[],"shortlink":"https:\/\/tcrn.ch\/2uPCXhO","rapidData":{"pt":"","pct":""},"featured":false,"subtitle":"","fundingRound":false,"seoTitle":"","seoDescription":"","tc_unified_tagging":[{"tag":{"term_id":449555589,"name":"algorithmic accountability","slug":"algorithmic-accountability","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":144683,"taxonomy":"post_tag","description":"","parent":0,"count":8,"filter":"raw"},"cb_tags":[]}],"associatedEvent":null,"event":null,"authors":[1674117],"hideFeaturedImage":false,"relatedArticles":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1674124"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1674124\/revisions"}],"authors":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/guest-authors\/joshua-new"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1674124&order=asc&tc_hierarchical=flat"}],"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/edit":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-admin\/post.php?post=1674124&action=edit"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/tc\/v1\/users\/84837756"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/1330955"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1674124"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1674124"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1674124"},{"taxonomy":"_tc_cb_tag_taxonomy","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/crunchbase_tag?post=1674124"},{"taxonomy":"tc_stories_tax","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_stories_tax?post=1674124"},{"taxonomy":"tc_event","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_event?post=1674124"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]},"_embedded":{"authors":[{"id":1674117,"name":"Joshua New","link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/author\/joshua-new\/","description":"Joshua New is a senior policy analyst at the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.datainnovation.org\/\">Center for Data Innovation<\/a>, a think tank studying the intersection of data, technology and public policy.\r\n\r\n","slug":"joshua-new","links":[],"position":"Contributor","cbDescription":"","cbAvatar":"","twitter":""}],"replies":[[{"id":609872,"parent":0,"author":0,"author_name":"Frederik Krautwald","author_url":"","date":"2018-07-26T13:12:18","content":{"rendered":"<p>Who is supposed to make this so-called policy framework?

href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/05\/10\/google-search-will-now-help-you-find-nearby-events\/\">launched a new events feature<\/a> designed to help web searchers more easily find things to do nearby, while also challenging Facebook&#8217;s dominance in the local events space. Today, Google is updating event search with personalized event suggestions, and well as a new design that puts more event information directly in the search results.<\/p>\n<p>When the feature first launched last year, Google said it was built in response to the millions of search queries the company saw daily for finding local events and activities.<\/p>\n<p>However, it was also clearly an area where Google had ceded ground to Facebook. The social network said last fall that 100 million people were using Facebook Events on a daily basis, and 650 million were using it across the network. Those numbers have surely grown since.<\/p>\n<p>The original design for Google&#8217;s events search offered web searchers a list of events they could filter by category and date. Meanwhile, the event listings themselves were powered by data from\u00a0Eventbrite, Ticketmaster, SeatGeek, Meetup, Vividseats, Jambase, LiveNation, Burbio, Allevents.in, Bookmyshow.com, StubHub, Bandsintown, Yext and Eventful.<\/p>\n<p>Now, Google is returning these event results in a new format &#8212; instead of more standard search results, they appear as cards, each with a little bookmark icon you can click on to save the event details for future reference.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, when you tap on one of the event listings&#8217; cards, you&#8217;re directed to a more information-rich page, offering the date, time, location and shortcuts to save the event, buy tickets, get directions or share it with others. The design looks even more like a Facebook event page, albeit without a discussion section for posts and comments.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1681071\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Events_in_Search.gif?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"680\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Clicking on the &#8220;Get tickets&#8221; button will pop up a window that links to ticket resellers for the event in question &#8212; like Ticketmaster or StubHub, for example.<\/p>\n<p>As users continue to click, browse and save events, the system will also be trained to know what sort of events users like.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1681070\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Events_For_You.gif?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"680\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This data will be used to power the new personalized recommendations feature, found in the bottom navigation bar&#8217;s &#8220;For You&#8221; tab, which organizes suggested events by category, like &#8220;concerts,&#8221; &#8220;festivals,&#8221; &#8220;shows,&#8221; free events and more.

now supports PGP encryption with other clients"},"content":{"rendered":"<p><a href=\"https:\/\/protonmail.com\">ProtonMail<\/a> is arguably the easiest way to send end-to-end encrypted emails. But encryption only works by default with other ProtonMail users. The company is <a href=\"https:\/\/protonmail.com\/blog\/address-verification-pgp-support\/\">adding<\/a> full PGP support so that you can send and receive encrypted emails with people who use other apps and services.<\/p>\n<p>ProtonMail is pretty much like iMessage or WhatsApp, but for email. All communications between two users are seamlessly encrypted. It\u2019s transparent for the end user as you don\u2019t need to manage encryption keys yourself.<\/p>\n<p>But encrypted emails have been around for longer than ProtonMail. OpenPGP-compliant apps let you encrypt and digitally sign emails before sending them, even if your recipient isn&#8217;t using the same app. On the recipient\u2019s side, you can check the sender\u2019s signature and decrypt the message.<\/p>\n<p>But PGP requires that both senders and recipients know how to use the standard. There are many extensions and plugins to use PGP in email apps. And now, ProtonMail lets you manage PGP communications directly in its service.<\/p>\n<p>ProtonMail was already using PGP in the background. But now, the service is exposing those features to advanced users. You can import PGP public keys for your contacts and export your own key to share it with others. Encryption and decryption is then fully automated.<\/p>\n<p>In order to make that possible, ProtonMail is launching an API to fetch public key encryption keys from ProtonMail users. Many users put their PGP key on their Twitter profile or website. But if you already know the ProtonMail email address of your recipient, you can get it from your browser directly (<code>https:\/\/api.protonmail.ch\/pks\/lookup?op=get&amp;search=username@protonmail.com<\/code>).<\/p>\n<p>Finally, exposing public keys also enables a new feature \u2014 address verification. If a server gets compromised or there\u2019s a Man-in-the-Middle attack, a person could send an email pretending to be you but with a completely different set of public and private keys.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re handling highly sensitive information, you can now manually verify the address of a specific contact. For instance, if you\u2019re meeting with a contact in person, this person can show you their public key so that you can check it against your inbox. If those two keys are identical, you can choose to trust this key for future communications.<\/p>\n<p>This is an overkill for your vacation photos, but Edward Snowden would love this kind of feature. ProtonMail is keeping basic encryption features accessible while giving more control to power users. This is a great way to get started and learn more about PGP, public and private keys as well as best practices.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>ProtonMail is arguably the easiest way to send end-to-end encrypted emails.

The extent of their efforts was truly staggering.<\/p>\n<p>One defendant, Miteshkumar Patel of Illinois, received 240 months in prison followed by three years of probation. Patel, wrote the Department of Justice, &#8220;served as the manager of a Chicago-based crew of &#8216;runners&#8217; that liquidated and laundered fraud proceeds generated by callers at India-based call centers.&#8221;<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Those callers used call scripts and lead lists to target victims throughout the United States with telefraud schemes in which the callers impersonated U.S. government employees from the IRS and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). The callers duped victims into believing that they owed money to the U.S. government and would be arrested or deported if they did not pay immediately. After the victims transferred money to the callers, a network of U.S.-based runners moved expeditiously to liquidate and launder fraud proceeds through the use of anonymous stored value cards. In addition to recruiting, training, and tasking runners in his crew, Patel also coordinated directly with the Indian side of the conspiracy about the operation of the scheme. Patel was held accountable for laundering between $9.5 and $25 million for the scheme.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The scam &#8212; familiar to anyone with a phone number &#8212; involves a robocall that appears to be from the IRS.

The company\u2019s platform is designed to help cut through bureaucratic tape that can prevent people from accessing important services.\u00a0Either using a web app or text messaging, users can determine their eligibility to receive food stamp services. Recent updates to the platform now let users in certain locations go through the entire application process using the web or SMS platform.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOur mission has long been to restore dignity by transforming access to social services,\u201d Rose Afriyie, mRelief co-founder and executive director, told TechCrunch <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/01\/08\/mrelief-launches-end-to-end-food-stamp-enrollment-service\/\">earlier this year<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The company has helped more than 230,000 families since <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/03\/17\/launching-at-ycs-demo-day-mrelief-has-a-new-tool-to-make-public-assistance-more-accessible\/\">launching out of Y Combinator in 2016<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Incarcerated individuals are already cut off from society, and when calling friends and family is too cost-prohibitive, it intensifies the isolation. Frederick Hutson, CEO of <a href=\"https:\/\/pigeonly.com\/\">Pigeon.ly<\/a>, started the company to help minimize those costs. Hutson, who served four years in prison for drug trafficking, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2015\/03\/24\/pigeon-ly\/\">knows all too well<\/a> the burden this creates. Since the company was founded in 2012, its services have expanded beyond voice. It also allows users to connect to their inmates with photos and letters.<\/p>\n<p>In San Francisco, there is an app that allows users to help people in need. Currently available only in the Tenderloin in San Francisco,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.concrn.org\/\">Concrn<\/a> was designed to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/10\/29\/concrn-is-a-911-alternative-that-helps-people-during-mental-health-crises\/\">provide an alternative<\/a> to calling emergency services. If a user sees someone in emotional or behavioral crisis, they can use the app to report it to a trained Concrn Responder. This helps to alleviate stress on the 911 system and prevents people from unwillingly going into the medical system.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOur focus has been to create economic opportunities for people in the Tenderloin community who have previously been marginalized or unable to access employment and also people who have experienced their own mental health crisis in the past,\u201d Neil Shah,\u00a0Concrn co-executive director, told TechCrunch last year.<\/p>\n<p>Phaedra Ellis-Lamkins, Rose Afriyie, Frederick Hutson and Neil Shah will be on the Disrupt SF stage in just a few weeks to talk about using technology to effect change in a society that badly needs it.<\/p>\n<p>The\u00a0full agenda is <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/events\/disrupt-sf-2018\/\">here<\/a>. Passes for the show are available at the early-bird rate until August 1 <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/events\/disrupt-sf-2018\/?ref=speakerpost39&amp;unii-trigger-open=GSLDXW\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ride-hailing, social interactions from behind tiny screens and fitness tracking are just a few of the things we\u2019ve all become accustomed to thanks to innovative app-makers.

snagged <a href=\"https:\/\/variety.com\/2018\/digital\/news\/meg-whitman-tapped-as-ceo-of-jeffrey-katzenbergs-mobile-content-venture-1202674576\/\">Meg Whitman as CEO<\/a> in January, has now closed on $1 billion in funding, according to a <a href=\"https:\/\/money.cnn.com\/2018\/07\/26\/technology\/pacific-newsletter\/index.html\">report out today in CNN<\/a>. Investors in the round include\u00a0Disney, 21st Century Fox, Warner Bros, Entertainment One and other media companies, with a combined $200 million investment, while institutional investors from the U.S. and China made up the rest.<\/p>\n<p>The news follows a May report from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2018-05-11\/katzenberg-s-newtv-video-startup-is-said-to-raise-800-million\">Bloomberg<\/a>, which said NewTV had then raised around $800 million. It had also said 21st Century Fox and Warner Bros. were investors.<\/p>\n<p>Last fall, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/10\/03\/jeffrey-katzenberg-new-startup\/\">an SEC filing revealed<\/a> WndrCo was looking to raise as much as $2 billion. That could indicate that the round CNN is reporting is still in the process of raising.<\/p>\n<p>NewTV declined to comment, when TechCrunch reached them for confirmation.<\/p>\n<p>Details are still fairly sparse on NewTV, which is being incubated by Katzenberg&#8217;s WndrCo, a holding company that&#8217;s also invested in startups including <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/04\/16\/a-self-facilitating-media-node\/\">Mixcloud<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/11\/17\/media-startup-axios-raises-another-20-million\/\">Axios<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/04\/17\/node-snags-a-couple-of-top-ai-researchers-to-advance-ai-fueled-search-tool\/\">Node<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/12\/01\/flowspace\/\">Flowspace<\/a>, Whistle Sports, and TYT Network.<\/p>\n<p>So far, we know NewTV aims to bring high-quality Hollywood production values and storytelling to mobile, but in a different format. Instead of producing regular-length TV shows, it aims to release content in &#8220;bite-sized formats of 10 minutes or less.&#8221; This will also involve custom-designed technology built specifically for mobile, it <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/home\/20180124005836\/en\/Meg-Whitman-Joins-NewTV-CEO\">claims<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>But it&#8217;s unclear why &#8211; beyond having\u00a0Katzenberg and now Whitman&#8217;s names attached &#8211; this makes the company worth a billion dollar investment. The market for this type of content hasn&#8217;t really been proven out. After all, today&#8217;s youngest video consumers are happy with YouTube &#8211; their TV alternative of sorts &#8211; which is filled with short-form video.<\/p>\n<p>And while YouTubers&#8217; grasp of production values and storytelling chops may fall short of &#8220;Hollywood&#8221; standards, streaming services like Amazon, Netflix, Hulu and others are filling in the gaps in terms of quality, and are growing sizable subscriber bases.<\/p>\n<p>If there is\u00a0<em>actually<\/em> demand for &#8220;high-quality short-form&#8221; video, it seems content producers could just sell to existing distributors directly.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also unclear for now if NewTV aims to own and distribute its content to others, act as its own standalone streaming service, or plans for a mixture of both.<\/p>\n<p>In any event, as CNN points out, even a large round like this is a small bet for the bigger media companies involved. In addition, they don&#8217;t want to miss a shot at backing\u00a0Katzenberg&#8217;s latest &#8211; especially given his prior successes at Paramount, Disney and DreamWorks.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Jeffrey Katzenberg&#8217;s new mobile video startup NewTV, which snagged Meg Whitman as CEO in January, has now closed on $1 billion in funding, according to a report out today in CNN.

We both believe in doing the right thing for developers. We believe that success as it relates to cloud adoption comes from collaborating in the ecosystem,&#8221; she said.<\/p>\n<p>Given that close relationship, it had to be disappointing on some level when Microsoft acquired GitHub. In fact, Google Cloud head, Diane Greene expressed sadness about the deal in an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2018\/07\/24\/google-cloud-ceo-diane-greene-interview-at-next.html\">interview with CNBC<\/a> earlier this week, but GitHub&#8217;s SVP of Technology Jason Warner believes that Microsoft will be a good steward and that the relationship with Google will remain strong.<\/p>\n<p>Warner says the company&#8217;s founding principles were about not getting locked in to any particularly platform and he doesn&#8217;t see that changing after the acquisition is finalized. &#8220;One of the things that was critical in any discussion about an acquisition was that GitHub shall remain an open platform,&#8221; Warner explained.<\/p>\n<p>He indicated that today&#8217;s announcement is just a starting point, and the two companies intend to build on this integration moving forward. &#8220;We worked pretty closely on this together. This announcement is a nod to some of the future oriented partnerships that we will be announcing later in the year,&#8221; he said. And that partnership should continue unabated, even after the Microsoft acquisition is finalized later this year.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/google-cloud-next-2018\"><img src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/google-cloud-next-2018-banner.png\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When Microsoft acquired GitHub for $7.5 billion smackeroos in June, it sent some shock waves through the developer community as it is a key code repository.

publishing data on scores of pro-Brexit adverts which it distributed to UK voters during the 2016 referendum on European Union membership. The ads were run on behalf of several vote leave campaigns who paid a third company to use <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/facebook\/\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"facebook\">Facebook&#8217;s <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> ad targeting tools.<\/p>\n<p>The ads were run prior to Facebook having any disclosure rules for political ads. So there was no way for anyone other than each target recipient to know a particular ad existed or who it was being targeted at.<\/p>\n<p>The targeting of the ads was carried out on Facebook&#8217;s platform by AggregateIQ, a Canadian data firm that has been linked to Cambridge Analytica\/SCL &#8212; aka the political consultancy at the center of a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/04\/04\/cambridge-analytica-87-million\/\">massive Facebook data misuse storm<\/a>, including by Facebook itself, which earlier this year told the UK parliament it had found billing and administration connections between the two.<\/p>\n<p>Aggregate IQ is now\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/04\/06\/facebook-aggregateiq-now-being-jointly-probed-by-canada-b-c-data-watchdogs\/\">under joint investigation<\/a>\u00a0by Canadian data watchdogs.

The company eventually did so, releasing ads run by AIQ for the official Vote Leave campaign, BeLeave\/Brexit Central, and DUP Vote Leave.<\/p>\n<p>Several of the Brexit campaigns whose ads have now been made public were also\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/07\/17\/its-official-brexit-campaign-broke-the-law-with-social-medias-help\/\">recently found to have broken UK election law<\/a> by breaching campaign spending limits. Most notably the Electoral Commission found that the youth-focused campaign, BeLeave, had been joint-working with the official Vote Leave campaign &#8212; yet the pair had not jointly declared spending thereby enabling the official campaign to overspend by almost half a million pounds.\u00a0And that overspend went straight to\u00a0Aggregate IQ to run targeted Facebook ads.<\/p>\n<p>The committee has now published the Brexit ads that Facebook disclosed to it, more than two years after the referendum vote took place. Facebook also provided it with ad impression ranges and some targeting data which it has also published. The committee&#8217;s enquiry remains ongoing.<\/p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.parliament.uk\/documents\/commons-committees\/culture-media-and-sport\/Fake_news_evidence\/Letter-from-Rebecca-Stimson-Facebook-to-Chair-re-question-29-19-July-2018.pdf\">letter<\/a> to the committee, Facebook says it&#8217;s unable to disclose ads run by AIQ for another Brexit campaign, Veterans for Britain, saying that campaign &#8220;has not permitted us to disclose that information to you&#8221;.\u00a0So the view of the Brexit political ads we&#8217;re finally getting is by no means complete. Facebook&#8217;s platform also essentially enables anyone to be an advertiser &#8212; so it&#8217;s entirely possible other Brexit related messages were distributed using its ad tools.<\/p>\n<p>In the case of the Brexit ads run by AIQ specifically, it&#8217;s not clear how many ad impressions they racked up in all. But total impressions look very sizable.<\/p>\n<p>While some of what runs to many thousands of distinctly targeted ads which AIQ distributed via Facebook&#8217;s platform are listed as only garnering between 0-999 impressions apiece, according to Facebook&#8217;s data, others racked up far more views. Commonly listed ranges include 50,000 to 99,999 and 100,000 to 199,999 &#8212; with even higher ranges like 2M-4.9M and 5M-9.9M also listed.<\/p>\n<p>One ad that generated ad impressions of between 2M-4.9M was targeted almost exclusively (99%) at English Facebook users &#8212; and included the claim that:\u00a0&#8220;EU protectionism has prevented our generation from benefiting from key global trade deals. It is time we unite to give our country the freedom to be a prosperous and competitive nation!&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>A spokesperson for the DCMS committee told us it hadn&#8217;t had a chance to compiled the thousands of ad impression ranges into a total ad impression range &#8212; but had rather published the data as it had received it from Facebook. We&#8217;ve also asked the company to prove an estimate on the total ad impressions and will update this story with any response.<\/p>\n<p>The ad creative used by these campaigns has been published as well and &#8212; across all of them &#8212; the adverts display a mixture of (roundly debunked) claims about suddenly being able to spend &#8216;\u00a3350M a week on the NHS&#8217;, rousing calls to &#8216;take back control&#8217; (including a bunch of &#8216;hero&#8217; shots of Boris Johnson), coupled with ample fearmongering about EU regulations &#8216;holding the UK back&#8217; or posing a risk to UK jobs and wages; plus a lot of out-and-out &#8216;project fear&#8217; messaging &#8212; with the official Vote Leave campaign especially deploying direct dogwhistle racism to stir up fear among voters about foreigners coming to the UK if it can&#8217;t control its own border or if the EU expands to add more countries&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1680885\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Screen-Shot-2018-07-26-at-5.22.12-PM.png?w=600\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"314\" \/>\u00a0<img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1680890\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Screen-Shot-2018-07-26-at-5.25.05-PM.png?w=598\" alt=\"\" width=\"598\" height=\"313\" \/><\/p>\n<p>At a glance, the Brexit ad creative is not\u00a0as &#8216;out there&#8217; as some of the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/11\/01\/us\/politics\/russia-2016-election-facebook.html\">wilder stuff the Kremlin was pumping onto Facebook&#8217;s platform<\/a> to try to skew the 2016 U.S. election.<\/p>\n<p>But the blatant xenophobia leaves a very bad taste.<\/p>\n<p>In the case of Brexit Central\/BeLeave, their ad creative was more subtle in its xenophobia &#8212; urging target recipients to back a &#8220;fair immigration system&#8221; or an &#8220;Australian-style points based system&#8221; but without making any direct references to any specific non-EU countries.<\/p>\n<p>The youth campaign also created a couple of ads (below) which invoked consumer technology as a reason to back Brexit &#8212; with one appealing to users of ride-hailing and another to users of video streaming apps to reject the EU by suggesting its regulations might interfere with access to the services they use.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1680896\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Screen-Shot-2018-07-26-at-3.57.49-PM.png?w=601\" alt=\"\" width=\"601\" height=\"318\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1680902\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Screen-Shot-2018-07-26-at-3.58.11-PM.png?w=599\" alt=\"\" width=\"599\" height=\"323\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Ironically enough, it was London&#8217;s transport authority that <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/09\/22\/uber-loses-its-license-to-operate-in-london\/\">withdrew Uber&#8217;s license to operate last year<\/a> &#8212; in a regulatory decision that had absolutely nothing to do with the EU. (Uber has since appealed and got a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/06\/26\/uber-wins-appeal-and-gets-a-provisional-15-month-license-to-operate-in-london\/\">15-month reprieve<\/a>.)<\/p>\n<p>Though, also last year, the EU&#8217;s top court judged that a spade is a spade &#8212; and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/12\/20\/blow-to-uber-in-europe-as-top-court-rules-its-a-transport-service\/\">Uber is a transport company<\/a>, not a mere technology platform. Though the ruling has not prevented Uber from continuing to operate and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/05\/10\/uber-to-pop-up-a-service-in-spains-costa-del-sol-in-time-for-summer\/\">even expand ride-hailing services in Europe<\/a>. Sure, it has to work more closely with\u00a0city authorities now, but that means meshing with local priorities rather than seeking to override what local people want.<\/p>\n<p>In a further irony, the EU also took steps to liberalize passenger transport services, back in 2007, issuing a directive that makes it harder for cities authorities to place their own controls on ride-hailing services.\u00a0Albeit, evidently facts didn&#8217;t get a starring role in the vote leave Brexit ads.<\/p>\n<p>As for quotas on streaming services, it&#8217;s a curious thing to complain about &#8212; especially to a youth-focused audience which you&#8217;re also targeting with ads claiming they&#8217;ll have better job prospects outside the EU.<\/p>\n<p>The EU has merely suggested online streaming services should provide for and subsidize up to a third of their output of films and TV as being\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/technology\/2018\/apr\/26\/eu-third-party-trader-amazon-google-ebay\">made in Europe<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Which seems unlikely to have a\u00a0deleterious impact on European creative industries, given platforms would be contributing to the development of local audiovisual production. So &#8212; in plainer English &#8212; it should mean more money to support more creative jobs in Europe which many young people would probably love to have a crack at&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>The publication of the Brexit ads is, above all, a reminder that online political advertising has been allowed to be a blackhole &#8212; and at times a cesspit &#8212; because cash-rich entities have been able to unaccountably exploit the obscurity of Facebook&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/04\/28\/facebooks-dark-ads-problem-is-systemic\/\">systemically dark ad targeting tools<\/a> for their own ends, leaving no right of public objection let alone reply for the people as a whole whose lives are affected by political outcomes such as referendums.<\/p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/carolecadwalla\/status\/1022571070904303616\">others have pointed out<\/a>, some of the official Vote Leave ads do not include an imprint denoting that they are campaign material.

That&#8217;s why Instagram is experimenting with a way to show off a carousel of IGTV videos in its main app&#8217;s feed. Spotted by app researcher <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/wongmjane\">Jane Manchun Wong<\/a>, we asked Instagram about it. A spokesperson confirmed it was testing the carousel, and provided this statement: &#8220;We\u2019re always testing new and different ways to surface interesting content for people on Instagram.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"vertical size-large wp-image-1680865 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Instagram-IGTV-Feed-Carousel.jpg?w=383\" alt=\"\" width=\"383\" height=\"680\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The IGTV carousel appears below the Stories tray, pushing down the traditional feed so less of the first photo or video immediately appears on the screen. It shows a preview tile of the IGTV videos with overlaid titles and lengths, plus the creator&#8217;s name and profile pic. They look similar to Snapchat&#8217;s Discover page and the carousels of <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/10\/30\/instagram-stories-previews\/\">&#8220;Recent Stories&#8221; Instagram began running mid-feed last year.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>By teasing IGTV&#8217;s actual content rather than just slapping a logo button atop the screen, Instagram might get more users to check out the feature and standalone app. More views could in turn lure more content from creators. If they don&#8217;t see IGTV&#8217;s audience as significant, they won&#8217;t go to the trouble of shooting long-form vertical video for the platform or editing their landscape Instagram feed and YouTube videos for the format.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"pRZqP5lLEI\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/06\/20\/igtv\/\">Instagram launches IGTV app for creators, 1-hour video uploads<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/06\/20\/igtv\/embed\/#?secret=pRZqP5lLEI\" data-secret=\"pRZqP5lLEI\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" title=\"&#8220;Instagram launches IGTV app for creators, 1-hour video uploads&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1680867 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Instagram-IGTV-Screenshots.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"585\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Given yesterday&#8217;s bloodbath of a Facebook earnings report, there&#8217;s more pressure than ever on Instagram to pull its weight. Facebook sunk to its slowest growth rate in history, losing users in Europe and going flat in North America. In fact, it revealed a new &#8220;family of apps audience&#8221; metric of <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/07\/25\/facebook-2-5-billion-people\/\">2.5 billion people using at least one of Facebook&#8217;s apps<\/a> (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp or Messenger) to distract from the bad news. That stat will let Facebook hide how younger users are abandoning it in favor of Instagram.<\/p>\n<p>The big concern is that vertical videos and Stories are the future of content creation and consumption, but Facebook hasn&#8217;t figured out how to monetize these formats as well as its tried-and-true News Feed ads. Concerns about eyeballs shifting away from feeds faster than ad dollars contributed to Facebook&#8217;s 20 percent share price drop erasing $120 billion in market cap.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"EaHdVhYv4S\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/07\/25\/facebook-2-5-billion-people\/\">2.5 billion people use at least one of Facebook&#8217;s apps<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/07\/25\/facebook-2-5-billion-people\/embed\/#?secret=EaHdVhYv4S\" data-secret=\"EaHdVhYv4S\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" title=\"&#8220;2.5 billion people use at least one of Facebook&#8217;s apps&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>But Facebook&#8217;s saving grace, and the reason the stock might bounce back, is that it ruthlessly cloned Snapchat Stories for two years before it was obvious that it had to and now has 1.1 billion daily Stories users across its apps. If Facebook said Stories were the future but it was way behind, it could have been beaten down even worse by Wall Street.<\/p>\n<p>Still, short-form Stories are best paired with short-form Stories ads. If it can make IGTV a hit, it could run longer or unskippable ads that earn it more. So you can expect to see more and more of IGTV in the Instagram feed.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"6PSBh5KmCJ\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/07\/25\/fallbook\/\">Facebook loses $120 billion in market cap after awful Q2 earnings<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/07\/25\/fallbook\/embed\/#?secret=6PSBh5KmCJ\" data-secret=\"6PSBh5KmCJ\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" title=\"&#8220;Facebook loses $120 billion in market cap after awful Q2 earnings&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>IGTV didn&#8217;t get the benefit of being splayed out atop Instagram like Stories did.

Rekognition is a service, provided by Amazon, that allows for matching search images with elements of an image database based on user-defined accuracy parameters. It is only as good as the inputs it receives.<\/p>\n<p>All of the following can influence the rate of false positives:<br \/>\n&#8211; Image quality issues with search images<br \/>\n&#8211; Image quality issues with image database<br \/>\n&#8211; Configuration issues with accuracy settings<br \/>\n&#8211; Bias existing in image database<\/p>\n<p>Amazon did not configure this setup for ACLU, did not provide the mugshot database, and was not otherwise involved in the testing. If I were to set accuracy at 5%, 10%, or even 50% I would have incredibly high rates of false positives. Even at 90-95-99% there is a possibility of false positives between similar facial structures. We also need to acknowledge that there are flaws and bias in the legal system that lead to a higher-than-proportional amount of people of color being arrested and having mugshots in the database. With larger representation in the image database, there is a higher likelihood of false positive matches.<br \/>\nWhat the ACLU is saying boils down to \u2018We used a service, configured it ourselves, with a possibly-biased database that we selected, and found biased results in the output.\u2019 None of this points to Amazon negatively targeting specific demographics. Blaming Amazon for the association with the mugshots is ridiculous. The responsibility for proper use of the service is on the user who configure the service and verify that the image database is not inherently biased \u2013 in this case ACLU.<\/p>\n<p>Anyone can use a service properly or improperly, and the same goes for Rekognition. I\u2019m surprised that Brian Heater didn\u2019t raise this viewpoint but it seems to be the standard for Techcrunch reporting lately.<\/p>\n"},"link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/07\/26\/aclu-says-amazon-facial-recognition-associated-congress-members-with-mugshots\/#comment-609854","type":"comment","author_avatar_urls":{"24":"https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/54e98946fda05f271a0b9e97af48541d?s=24&d=identicon&r=g","48":"https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/54e98946fda05f271a0b9e97af48541d?s=48&d=identicon&r=g","96":"https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/54e98946fda05f271a0b9e97af48541d?s=96&d=identicon&r=g"},"techcrunch":{"avatar":"https:\/\/ct.yimg.com\/cy\/1768\/39361574426_98028a_64sq.jpg","company":"(no company found)","title":"(no title found)","user":"54IFHEG4CRGOSD6H6OJI2DRHFV"},"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments\/609854"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"post_type":"post","href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1680913"}],"children":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?parent=609854"}]}}]],"author":[{"id":699688,"name":"Brian Heater","url":"","description":"","link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/author\/brian-heater\/","slug":"brian-heater","avatar_urls":{"24":"https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/69b6dc548d05dedd0132f12e075bf7de?s=24&d=identicon&r=g","48":"https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/69b6dc548d05dedd0132f12e075bf7de?s=48&d=identicon&r=g","96":"https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/69b6dc548d05dedd0132f12e075bf7de?s=96&d=identicon&r=g"},"links":{"twitter":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/bheater","linkedin":"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/pub\/brian-heater\/1\/a92\/94","crunchbase":"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/person\/brian-heater"},"position":"Hardware Editor","cbDescription":"<p>Brian Heater is the Hardware Editor at TechCrunch.

target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"facebook\">Facebook <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/07\/26\/facebook-officially-loses-123-billion-in-value\/\">had a rough day yesterday<\/a> when its stock plunged <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/07\/25\/facebook-q2-2018-earnings\/\">after a poor earnings report<\/a>. What better way to pick yourself up and dust yourself off than to buy a little something for yourself. Today the company announced<a href=\"https:\/\/redkix.com\/\"> it has acquired Redkix,<\/a> a startup that provides tools to communicate more effectively by combining email with a more formal collaboration tool. The companies did not reveal the acquisition price.<\/p>\n<p>Redkix burst out of the gate two years ago <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/07\/12\/with-17m-in-seed-funding-redkix-wants-to-combine-the-best-of-email-and-chat\/\">with a $17 million seed round<\/a>, a hefty seed amount by any measure. What prompted this kind of investment was a tool that combined a collaboration tool like Slack or Workplace by Facebook with email. People could collaborate in Redkix itself, or if you weren&#8217;t a registered user, you could still participate by email, providing a more seamless way to work together.<\/p>\n<p>Alan Lepofsky, who covers enterprise collaboration at Constellation Research, sees this tool as providing a key missing link. &#8220;Redkix is a great solution for bridging the worlds between traditional email messaging and more modern conversational messaging. Not all enterprises are ready to simply switch from one to the other, and Redkix allows for users to work in whichever method they want, seamlessly communicating with the other,&#8221; Lepofsky told TechCrunch.<\/p>\n<p>As is often the case with these kinds of acquisitions, the company bought the technology\u00a0 itself along with the team that created it. This means that the Redkix team including the CEO and CTO will join Facebook and they will very likely be shutting down the application after the acquisition is finalized.<\/p>\n<p>Lepofsky thinks\u00a0that enterprises that are adopting Facebook&#8217;s enterprise tool will be able to more seamlessly transition between the two modes of communication, the Workplace by Facebook tool and email, as they prefer.<\/p>\n<p>Although a deal like this has probably been in the works for some time, after yesterday&#8217;s earning&#8217;s debacle, Facebook could be looking for ways to enhance its revenue in areas beyond the core Facebook platform. The enterprise collaboration tool does offer a possible way to do that in the future, and if they can find a way to incorporate email into it, it could make it a more attractive and broader offering.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/03\/18\/the-great-enterprise-chat-race\/\">Facebook is competing with Slack<\/a>, the darling of this space and others like Microsoft, Cisco and Google around communications and collaboration. When it launched in 2015, it was trying to take that core Facebook product and put it in a business context, something Slack had been doing since the beginning.<\/p>\n<p>To succeed in business,<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/10\/11\/facebook-is-about-to-learn-the-enterprise-is-a-different-animal\/\"> Facebook had to think differently<\/a> than as a consumer tool, driven by advertising revenue and had to convince large organizations that they understood their requirements. Today, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/workplace\/case-studies\">Facebook claims 30,000 organizations<\/a> are using the tool and over time they have built in integrations to other key enterprise products, and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/04\/18\/workplace-by-facebook-continues-to-mature\/\">keep enhancing it.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Perhaps with today&#8217;s acquisition, they can offer a more flexible way to interact with the platform and could increase those numbers over time.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Facebook had a rough day yesterday when its stock plunged after a poor earnings report.

Over the course of a management career that lasted 39 years, he won 49 major trophies, making him the most successful manager in the history of British football.<\/p>\n\n<p>He made his name with Aberdeen, who became the first club to consistently break the Old Firm dominance of the Scottish game, winning 9 domestic trophies over a 6 year period. But it was victory over Real Madrid in the European Cup-Winners Cup Final in 1983 that brought him to national attention.<\/p>\n\n<p>Following his move to Manchester United in 1986, he set about restructuring the club and his first trophy in 1990 opened the floodgates. In 2001 he became the first manager to win three championships in a row since the league began in 1888, a feat he repeated in 2009.<\/p>\n\n<p>Admired for placing his emphasis on attacking football, with homegrown talent at the heart of his teams, he bowed out as league champion following his 1,500th game in charge of Manchester United.<\/p>\n\n<p>In 2012, Harvard Business School wrote the case study \u201cSir Alex Ferguson: Managing Manchester United\u201d before appointing him as a Fellow to the Executive Education Programme.<\/p>\n\n<p>Following his retirement in 2013 he took up the positions of both Director and Global Ambassador with Manchester United and was also appointed Coaching Ambassador by UEFA. In the same year he released \"My Autobiography\"\u200b which became the UK's quickest selling non-fiction book since records began. This work was a follow-up to his first best-selling memoir, \"Managing My Life\", which appeared in 1999.<\/p>\n\n<p>His new book \u2018Leading\u2019, written with Sir Michael Moritz, details the key skills and philosophies he used to deliver success both on and off the field and will be released in September 2015.<\/p>","cbAvatar":"https:\/\/crunchbase-production-res.cloudinary.com\/image\/upload\/v1447886197\/fch0vdzg78dny7x125vq.jpg","company":"Manchester United Football Club Limited","featured":0,"name":"Sir Alex Ferguson","position":"Director, Football Board","links":{"crunchbase":"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/person\/sir-alex-ferguson","twitter":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/furious_fergie","linkedin":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/siralexferguson"}},{"bio":"<p>Martha is  founder and executive chair of Doteveryone.org.uk.

Like many in the industry, he was drawn to venture capital for its forward-looking approach to business.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cI was an operator for a long time,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd as an operator, you focus on making the month, the quarter, the year. With venture, you\u2019re looking toward the horizon rather than the ground.\u201d\nThis perspective has proven fruitful. Jeremy has funded several companies that have since been acquired or gone public, most notably Snapchat, where he made the first investment. It\u2019s a track record that has landed him on the Forbes Midas List several times.<\/p>\n\n<p>In addition to completing an MBA at Stanford, Jeremy spent the \u201890s and early 2000s working for web pioneers such as Netscape, AOL, CitySearch, and Interactive Corp.

A lot of that is about keeping an open mind, about not rushing to judgment.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>With Snapchat, for example, he recognized a fundamental shift that created opportunity for a disruptor. Conventional wisdom held that the post-Facebook social media landscape was too crowded to accommodate another platform. Yet Snapchat went on to shape popular culture. Why?<\/p>\n\n<p>Jeremy saw that users on Facebook and Instagram posted mostly highlight reels of their lives, leading to performance anxiety\u2014and less posting. Users worried, \u201cWill I get enough likes?\u201d Conversely, Snapchat\u2019s disappearing photos, and the absence of likes and follower counts, removed the perceived risk of posting a photo. People could be themselves.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cToday, people express themselves through Snapchat stories, gifs, and stickers,\u201d he says. \u201cBefore that, it was emojis and emoticons. Before that, it was their AIM Buddy icon or their ASCII signature on Usenet. The same core driver \u2014 people seeking individuality \u2014 is being instantiated in different ways, through different media.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>Outside of Lightspeed, Jeremy was a founding trustee at Presidio Knolls School, a startup, progressive Mandarin-immersion PreK-8 school in San Francisco.<\/p>","cbAvatar":"https:\/\/crunchbase-production-res.cloudinary.com\/image\/upload\/eieznsxfakdohnf77mib","company":"Lightspeed Venture Partners","featured":0,"name":"Jeremy Liew","position":"Partner","links":{"crunchbase":"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/person\/jeremy-liew","twitter":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/jeremysliew","linkedin":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/jeremyliew"}},{"bio":"<p>Bobby Lo is the Founder and CEO of Vurb, a mobile search and messaging startup acquired by Snap Inc.
